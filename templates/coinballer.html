<h1>Coinballer</h1>

<p>Welcome to the game of Coinballer, the financial attrition warfare game.</p>

<p>In this game, up to 100 players are gambling on who has more resources.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>The rules are simple.</p>

<p>Players can make a bet or raise their bet at any time.</p>

<p>The game ends when 4383 bitcoin blocks have passed without a raise. This will take appoximately one month.</p>

<p>The player who has contributed the most money to the pot at the end of the game wins the whole pot, minus a small 2% fee for the host.</p>

<p>In the case of tie, funds are distributed equally and any fractional remainder is left with the host.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>To set up a game, you will need to be familiar with running a program on the command-line or in Terminal, although players will not need this functionality to play.<p>

<p>You can download the command-line client <a href="/coinballer">here</a>.</p>

<p>To start a new game, the command is ./coinballer new_game &lt;player 1 address&gt; &lt;player 2 address&gt; ...</p>

<p>For games with large numbers of players, place the addresses in players.txt one per line and run ./coinballer new_game players.txt</p>

<p>This command will provide a URL with the addresses and bets for participants to play with.</p>

<p>To make a bet players must send the appropriate amount of bitcoin to their betting address.</p>
